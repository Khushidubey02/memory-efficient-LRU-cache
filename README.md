This is an implementation of a Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache in Java. It removes the least used items when the cache is full.

## What I Learned
- HashMap and Doubly Linked List
- How to get and put in O(1) time
- Designing cache systems

## Tech Stack
- Java
- HashMap
- Doubly Linked List

## How it works
- Use HashMap for fast access
- Use DLL to keep track of recent usage
